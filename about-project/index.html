        <h2>Genesis for the Project</h2>
            <p>The inspiration for the project came from Will Huang. He is currently working on a year-long project on how to protect and secure the Open Internet. One of the most significant threats to protecting the Open Internet is adding trusted and factual information from figures of authorities, including world leaders.</p>

            <p>What if there was a way to visualize the frequency and relevance of certain keywords or phrases from a leader's Tweets? What insights could be drawn from that? Given that the four group members come from the U.S., Mexico, India, and Turkey, we wanted to focus on the leaders of those respective countries.</p>

        <h1>About the Leaders</h1>

        <h2>Joseph R. Biden</h2>
            <p>Joeseph (Joe) Biden is the 46th and current president of the United States. He assumed office on January 20, 2021. Joe Biden briefly worked as an attorney before turning to politics. He became the fifth-youngest U.S. senator in history as well as Delaware's longest-serving senator. His 2008 presidential campaign never gained momentum, but Democratic nominee Barack Obama selected him as his running mate, and Biden went on to serve two terms as the 47th vice president of the United States. In 2017, at the close of his administration, Obama presented Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Two years later Biden launched his campaign for U.S. president and was elected as the 46th president of the United States on November 3, 2020.</p>
