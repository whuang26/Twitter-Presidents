          <h2>U.S. President Joe Biden</h2>

          <div id="wordcloud_biden">

            <p>Of the top ten most relevant terms in President Biden’s Tweets in 2021, seven of them relate to key legislation that he championed as president. The top most relevant phrase was “bipartisan infrastructure deals”, which occurred thirty times. This phrase is referring to an Act formally known as the “Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act”. The bill passed on November 6, 2021. The Act was initially a $715 billion infrastructure package, but was later amended to include approximately $1.2 trillion in spending for items such as broadband access, clean water, electric gruid renewal in addition to the transportation and road proposals of the original House bill.</p>

            <p>The next two most relevant terms, “better agenda” (32 times) and “better act” (29 times) are both related to the Build Back Better (BBB) Plan. The BBB Plan is the core proposal by President Biden to rebuild the U.S. from the COVID-19 pandemic. The BBB plan is divided into three parts: The American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan, and the American Families Plan. The American Rescue Plan is a COVID-19 relief package signed into law in March 2021. The American Jobs Plan was unveiled on March 31, 2021 and spun off into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, with some aspects carrying over to the Build Back Better Act. The American Families Plan was announced by the Biden administration in April 2021 and was primarily focused on supporting the “care economy” with spending on childcare, pre-kindergarten, paid family and medical leave, making community college free, and health insurance subsidies. Many aspects of the American Families Plan were included in the Build Back Better Act. Although the Build Back Better Act was originally a $3.5 trillion package, the price was lowered to approximately $2.2 trillion. Although the Act needs all 50 Democratic senators to pass via the reconciliation process, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announced on December 19, 2021 that he would not support the bill because of the bill’s structure and the national debt. Nevertheless, the Act is expected to receive a formal Senate vote in early 2022.</p>

            <p>Many of the other key phrases in the top ten most relevant terms are connected to the above legislation and demonstrate that President Biden was focused on championing major legislation in his first year in office: “american rescue plan” (17 times), “bipartisan infrastructure law” (17 times), “better framework” (23 times), “american jobs plan” (16 times), and “children care” (22 times).</p>

            <p>The most frequent terms in President Biden’s Tweets are also connected to the legislation as well. The top five terms are: “build” (127 times), “jobs” (85 times), “economy” (67 times), “country” (60 times), and “better agenda” (32 times). These terms paint a picture of a President whose goal in 2021 is to support and champion legislation that would dramatically improve the economic and social infrastructure of the U.S.</p>


          <h2>Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</h2>

          </div>

            <p>For President Erdoğan, many of the most relevant terms and phrases are salutations and greetings. The most relevant one is “hayırlı olmasını diliyorum” (32 times), which translates to “I wish you good luck”. Another similar terms in the top ten are “milletimize hayırlı olmasını” (12 times), which translates to “good luck to our nation”, and “tebrik ediyorum” (31 times), which translates to “congratulations”. These phrases do not refer to one particular event or legislation that occurred in 2021. Instead, they are used by President Erdoğan to wish for the success of various events throughout the year. For example, he used the phrase “hayırlı olmasını diliyorum” to wish good luck for the opening of the New Adana Stadium on February 19, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1362824271467339777">(link)</a>, for the launch of the Türksat 5A satellite on June 28, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1409500741300109315">(link)</a>, and that the newly launched Turkovac coronavirus vaccine benefit all of humanity on December 22, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1473619005953003523">(link)</a>. The first phrase not to  be in a salutation is the 19th one, “gazi mustafa kemal” (five times). Gazi is a Turkish title for veterans and Turkic Muslim champions, and “mustafa kemal” is referring to  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founding father of the Republic of Turkey who served as its first president from 1923 to 1938. The Tweets featuring Mustafa Kemal Atatürk are about honoring his legacy. For example, President Erdoğan commemorated Turkey’s Republic Day on October 29 by thanking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and expressing his gratitude for founding the modern republic <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1453964816092123136">(link)</a>. Overall, based on an analysis of the most frequent keywords and phrases, President Erdoğan uses Twitter to show gratitude for projects and initiatives, and to spotlight positive developments.</p>


            <h2>Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador</h2>

            </div>

            <p>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has based the official communication strategy of his administration on one central pillar: his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnlRGar-_296KTsVL0R6MEbpwJzD8ppA">daily 7AM press conferences.</a> The rest of his communication channels, including Twitter, mainly have the role of maximizing the reach that his daily conferences have. Thus, several of his most tweeted terms include "conferencia de prensa" (press conference), "conferencia matutina" (morning conference) and "desde Palacio Nacional" (from the National Palace, the official residence where the conferences are held). Not without criticism, he has effectively used his daily press conferences to set the tone and discussion topics of the public debate every day, frequently drawing on controversial and debatable remarks.</p>

            <p>The rest of the top ten terms in AMLO's tweets are related to his main proposals and policies: infrastructure projects, welfare state, and a restructuring of the military. "Tren Maya" and "Refinería" refer to his administration's two hallmark infrastructure projects, the Mayan Train and the Dos Bocas Refinery. The Mayan Train is a 1000-mile intercity railway that will traverse the Yucatán peninsula in Southeast Mexico, and Dos Bocas is an oil refinery located in the Southeastern state of Tabasco poised to be Mexico's largest. Both projects have faced significant pushback from local communities and from the general public, which explains the administration's constant promotion of them in social media.</p>

            <p>Paragraph about welfare state and military; conclusion.</p>
