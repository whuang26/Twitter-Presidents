              <p style="color: black; font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"> Will Huang, a second year Harvard Kennedy School student, inspired the rest of the team to work on tweets from world leaders to answer two questions that sparked his curiousity: </p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #284184; text-align: justify; padding-left: 5px;"><i>What if there was a way to visualize the frequency and relevance of certain keywords or phrases from a leader's tweets?</i></p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #284184; text-align: justify; padding-left: 5px;"><i>What insights could be drawn from that?</i></p>

              <p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; text-align: justify; line-height: 30px;">By clicking each leader's image below, you can see our analyses and possible answers to Will's questions. We will help you start by displaying information about President Biden's tweets.</p>

            <br></br>

            <p style="text-align: center; line-height:40px; font-size: 18px;">Between January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022, President Biden (<a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden">@JoeBiden</a>) tweeted 486 tweets. As of January 14, 2022, these tweets received 2,277,382 replies, 3,851,612 retweets, 36,040,401 likes in total.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#284184"> Use the Pandemic to Dream Big and Rebuild a Better Country</h2>

            <h3 style="text-align: center; color:#284184">Key Twitter terms center on physical and social infrastructure goals</h3>

            <img src="images/wordclouds/wordcloud_biden_blue.svg" class = "wordcloud" alt="Wordcloud for US President Joseph Biden">

            <br></br>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Of the top ten most relevant terms in President Biden’s tweets in 2021, seven of them relate to key legislation that he championed as President. The top most relevant term is “bipartisan infrastructure deals”, which occurred thirty times. This term is referring to an Act formally known as the “Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act”. The Act passed on November 6, 2021. The Act was initially a $715 billion infrastructure package, but later amended to include approximately $1.2 trillion in spending for items such as broadband access, clean water, electric grid renewal, in addition to the transportation and road proposals of the original House bill.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The next two most relevant terms, “better agenda” (32 times) and “better act” (29 times) are both related to the Build Back Better (BBB) Plan. The BBB Plan is the core proposal by President Biden to rebuild the U.S. from the COVID-19 pandemic. The BBB plan is divided into three parts: The American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan, and the American Families Plan. The American Rescue Plan is a COVID-19 relief package signed into law in March 2021. The American Jobs Plan was unveiled on March 31, 2021 and spun off into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, with some aspects carrying over to the Build Back Better Act. The American Families Plan was announced by President Biden in April 2021 and was primarily focused on supporting the “care economy” with spending on childcare, pre-kindergarten, paid family and medical leave, community college, and health insurance subsidies. Many aspects of the American Families Plan were later included in the Build Back Better Act. Although the Build Back Better Act was originally a $3.5 trillion package, the price was lowered to approximately $2.2 trillion. Although the Act needs all 50 Democratic senators to pass via the reconciliation process, Democrat Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia announced on December 19, 2021 that he would not support the bill because of the bill’s structure and the national debt. Nevertheless, the Act is expected to receive a formal Senate vote in early 2022.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Many of the other key terms sorted by relevance in the top ten  are connected to the above legislation and demonstrate that President Biden was focused on championing major legislation in his first year in office: “american rescue plan” (17 times), “bipartisan infrastructure law” (17 times), “better framework” (23 times), “american jobs plan” (16 times), and “children care” (22 times).</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The most frequent terms in President Biden’s Tweets are also connected to the legislation as well. The top five terms by frequency are: “build” (127 times), “jobs” (85 times), “economy” (67 times), “country” (60 times), and “better agenda” (32 times). These terms paint a picture of a President whose goal in 2021 is to support and champion legislation that would dramatically improve the economic and social infrastructure of the U.S.</p>

            <br></br>

            <p style="text-align: center; line-height:40px; font-size: 18px;">Between January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022, Prime Minister Modi (<a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi">@narendramodi</a>) tweeted 2901 tweets. As of January 14, 2022, these tweets received 3,047,937 replies, 13,894,601 retweets, 81,783,626 likes in total.</p>

            <br></br>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The top tweeted terms of Prime Minister Modi reflect policy decisions and government priorities as well as major socio-cultural events of the year.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The term "Atmanirbhar Bharat" (seven times, translates to self-reliant India), an umbrella policy campaign to encourage innovation in the economy guided by infrastructural and technological self-reliance, finds significant mention. The Atmanirbhar Bharat package, valued at ₹29.87 lakh crore (~$388.3 billion as of January 2022), was announced by the government to address the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Under the scope of the Atmanirbhar policy, the government-initiated policy changes broaden the scope of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), boost private participation in numerous sectors such as defense manufacturing, augment supply chain capacity for agriculture, and introduce rational tax systems.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Another key policy term is "climate change" (six times). In 2021, Prime Minister Modi announced new climate goals for India at the COP26 Climate Change Conference, including reaching net zero emissions by 2070 and setting aggressive near-term targets. In pledging a goal of net zero emissions, he outlined India’s expectation that the world's developed countries make $1 trillion in climate financing available at the earliest.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Consistent with political communication in India, top terms tweeted included congratulatory tweets (best wishes), condolence messages (om shanti, or bereaved family, fourteen times), and references to important socio-cultural days (jayanti, 21 times). Similarly, cultural, social, and religious icons included "Sri Guru Nanak" (four times), "Birsa Munda" (five times), "Lord Buddha" (five times), and "Atal ji" (six times) were top terms.</p>
              
            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">"Kashi Vishwanath Dham" (three times) and "Saryu Nahar national" project (four times), both inaugurated in 2021, are the two top terms related to government infrastructure projects. The annual "Padma Awards" (three times) also received significant attention through Prime Minister’s tweets. Prime Minister Modi changed the nomination process for the Padma Awards so that anyone could nominate anyone they thought were deserving of the highest civilian awards from their government. The movement soon came to be dubbed as People’s Padma with the application, process, winners, and ceremony finding featured on the Prime Minister’s twitter account.</p> 

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The terms "healthy life" (twelve times), "good health" (five times), and "ease of living" (five times) are in line with the Prime Minister’s previous use of social media to bring focus on health and quality of life in India.</p>

            <br></br>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has based the official communications strategy of his administration on one central pillar: his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnlRGar-_296KTsVL0R6MEbpwJzD8ppA">daily 7AM press conferences.</a> The rest of his communications channels, including Twitter, mainly serve to maximize the reach of his daily conference. Thus, several of his most tweeted terms include "conferencia de prensa" (85 times, translates to press conference), "conferencia matutina" (171 times, translates to morning conference) and "desde Palacio Nacional" (51 times, translates to from the National Palace and the location where the conferences are held). Not without criticism, he has effectively used his daily press conferences to set the tone and discussion topics of the public debate, frequently drawing on controversial and debatable remarks.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The rest of most relevant terms in AMLO's tweets are related to his main proposals and policies: infrastructure projects, welfare state, and a restructuring of the military. "Tren Maya" (nine times) and "Refinería" (seven times) refer to his administration's two hallmark infrastructure projects, the Mayan Train and the Dos Bocas Refinery. The Mayan Train is a $16 billion, 1000-mile intercity railway that will traverse the Yucatán peninsula in Southeast Mexico, and Dos Bocas is a $12 billion oil refinery located in the Southeastern state of Tabasco poised to be Mexico's largest. Both projects have faced significant pushback from local communities and from the general public, which explains the administration's constant promotion of the projects in social media.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">"Oaxaca" (21 times) and "Guerrero" (25 times), the other two of AMLO's most tweeted terms, are the names of two underdeveloped Mexican states on which his government has focused its social policy. Welfare, or "bienestar" (21 times), has been another of the administration's pillars, and citizens in these states are among the most heavily targeted by social programs. Finally, another relevant term in AMLO's tweets is "Guardia Nacional" (15 times), or National Guard, a civilian police force to which his administration has been assigning increasingly significant administrative and political roles within the government. Recently, the President announced the plan of merging the National Guard into the Army, a move that <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/04/29/mexicos-president-is-giving-the-armed-forces-new-powers">has been critized</a> given his campaign commitment to demilitarize public safety operations in the country.</p>

            <br></br>        

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">For President Erdoğan, many of the most relevant terms and phrases are salutations and greetings. The most relevant one is “hayırlı olmasını diliyorum” (32 times), which translates to “I wish you good luck”. Other similar terms in his top ten most relevant terms are “milletimize hayırlı olmasını” (12 times), which translates to “good luck to our nation”, and “tebrik ediyorum” (31 times), which translates to “congratulations”. These terms do not refer to one particular event or legislation that occurred in 2021. Instead, they are used by President Erdoğan to wish for the success of various events throughout the year. For example, he used the phrase “hayırlı olmasını diliyorum” to wish good luck for the opening of the New Adana Stadium on February 19, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1362824271467339777">(link)</a>, for the launch of the Türksat 5A satellite on June 28, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1409500741300109315">(link)</a>, and that the newly launched Turkovac coronavirus vaccine benefit all of humanity on December 22, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1473619005953003523">(link)</a>. The first phrase not to be in a salutation is the 19th one, “gazi mustafa kemal” (five times). Gazi is a Turkish title for veterans and Turkic Muslim champions, and “mustafa kemal” is referring to  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founding father of the Republic of Turkey who served as its first president from 1923 to 1938. The tweets featuring Mustafa Kemal Atatürk are focused on honoring his legacy. For example, President Erdoğan commemorated Turkey’s Republic Day on October 29 by thanking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and expressing his gratitude for founding the modern Turkish republic <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1453964816092123136">(link)</a>. Overall, based on an analysis of the most frequent terms and phrases, President Erdoğan uses Twitter to show gratitude for projects and initiatives, and to spotlight positive developments.</p>
