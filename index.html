            <p style="text-align: center; line-height:40px; font-size: 18px;">Between January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022, President Biden (<a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden">@JoeBiden</a>) tweeted 486 tweets. As of January 14, 2022, these tweets received 2,277,382 replies, 3,851,612 retweets, 36,040,401 likes in total.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#284184"> U.S. President Joe Biden: Use the Pandemic to Dream Big and Rebuild a Better Country</h2>

            <h3 style="text-align: center; color:#284184">Key Twitter terms center on physical and social infrastructure goals</h3>

            <img src="images/wordclouds/wordcloud_biden_blue.svg" class = "wordcloud" alt="Wordcloud for US President Joseph Biden">

            <br></br>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Of the top ten most relevant terms in President Biden’s Tweets in 2021, seven of them relate to key legislation that he championed as president. The top most relevant phrase was “bipartisan infrastructure deals”, which occurred thirty times. This phrase is referring to an Act formally known as the “Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act”. The bill passed on November 6, 2021. The Act was initially a $715 billion infrastructure package, but was later amended to include approximately $1.2 trillion in spending for items such as broadband access, clean water, electric gruid renewal in addition to the transportation and road proposals of the original House bill.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The next two most relevant terms, “better agenda” (32 times) and “better act” (29 times) are both related to the Build Back Better (BBB) Plan. The BBB Plan is the core proposal by President Biden to rebuild the U.S. from the COVID-19 pandemic. The BBB plan is divided into three parts: The American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan, and the American Families Plan. The American Rescue Plan is a COVID-19 relief package signed into law in March 2021. The American Jobs Plan was unveiled on March 31, 2021 and spun off into the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, with some aspects carrying over to the Build Back Better Act. The American Families Plan was announced by the Biden administration in April 2021 and was primarily focused on supporting the “care economy” with spending on childcare, pre-kindergarten, paid family and medical leave, making community college free, and health insurance subsidies. Many aspects of the American Families Plan were included in the Build Back Better Act. Although the Build Back Better Act was originally a $3.5 trillion package, the price was lowered to approximately $2.2 trillion. Although the Act needs all 50 Democratic senators to pass via the reconciliation process, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announced on December 19, 2021 that he would not support the bill because of the bill’s structure and the national debt. Nevertheless, the Act is expected to receive a formal Senate vote in early 2022.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Many of the other key phrases in the top ten most relevant terms are connected to the above legislation and demonstrate that President Biden was focused on championing major legislation in his first year in office: “american rescue plan” (17 times), “bipartisan infrastructure law” (17 times), “better framework” (23 times), “american jobs plan” (16 times), and “children care” (22 times).</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The most frequent terms in President Biden’s Tweets are also connected to the legislation as well. The top five terms are: “build” (127 times), “jobs” (85 times), “economy” (67 times), “country” (60 times), and “better agenda” (32 times). These terms paint a picture of a President whose goal in 2021 is to support and champion legislation that would dramatically improve the economic and social infrastructure of the U.S.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; line-height:40px; font-size: 18px;">Between January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2022, Prime Minister Modi (<a href="https://twitter.com/narendramodi">@narendramodi</a>) tweeted 2901 tweets. As of January 14, 2022, these tweets received 3,047,937 replies, 13,894,601 retweets, 81,783,626 likes in total.</p>

            <br></br>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The top tweeted terms of Prime Minister Modi reflect policy decisions and government priorities as well as major socio-cultural events of the year.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The term ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (translates to self-reliant India) an umbrella policy campaign to encourage innovation in the economy guided by infrastructural and technological self-reliance, finds significant mention.  The Atmanirbhar Bharat package worth ₹29.87 lakh crore was announced by the government in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Under the ambit of the Atmanirbhar policy, the government-initiated policy changes to broaden the scope of MSMEs, boost private participation in numerous sectors including in defense manufacturing, augmenting supply chain capacity for agriculture, and introducing rational tax systems.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Another key policy term was ‘climate change’. In 2021, Prime Minister Modi announced new climate goals for India at the #COP26 summit, including reaching net zero emissions by 2070 and set aggressive near-term targets. In pledging towards net zero emission, he outlined India’s expectation that the developed countries make $1 trillion available as climate finance at the earliest.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Consistent with political communication in India, top terms tweeted have included congratulatory tweets (best wishes), condolence messages (om shanti, bereaved family), and references to important socio-cultural days (jayanti). Similarly, cultural, social, and religious icons included ‘Sri Guru Nanak’, ‘Birsa Munda’, ‘Lord Buddha’, and ‘Atal ji’ were top terms.</p>
              
            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Kashi Vishwanath Dham and Saryu Nahar national project, both inaugurated in 2021, are the two top terms related government infrastructure projects. The annual Padma Awards also received significant attention through Prime Minister’s tweets. Prime Minister Modi changed the nomination process for the Padma Awards so that anyone could nominate anyone they thought were deserving of the highest civilian awards from their government. The movement soon came to be dubbed as People’s Padma with the application, process, winners, and ceremony finding featured on the Prime Minister’s twitter account.</p> 

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">Three terms ‘healthy life’, ‘good health’, and ‘ease of living’ have been mentioned repeatedly and are in line with the Prime Minister’s previous use of social media to bring focus on health and quality of life in India.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center; color:#284184">Rally support for infrastructure and social welfare projects and defend government efforts</h3>

            <img src="images/wordclouds/wordcloud_amlo_blue.svg" style="width: 725px; height:725px; padding-left:0px; padding-right:5px; padding-bottom:20px" class = "wordcloud" alt="Wordcloud for Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador">

            <br></br>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) has based the official communication strategy of his administration on one central pillar: his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnlRGar-_296KTsVL0R6MEbpwJzD8ppA">daily 7AM press conferences.</a> The rest of his communication channels, including Twitter, mainly have the role of maximizing the reach that his daily conferences have. Thus, several of his most tweeted terms include "<b>conferencia de prensa</b>" (press conference), "<b>conferencia matutina</b>" (morning conference) and "<b>desde Palacio Nacional</b>" (from the National Palace, the official residence where the conferences are held). Not without criticism, he has effectively used his daily press conferences to set the tone and discussion topics of the public debate every day, frequently drawing on controversial and debatable remarks.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">The rest of most relevant terms in AMLO's tweets are related to his main proposals and policies: infrastructure projects, welfare state, and a restructuring of the military. "<b>Tren Maya</b>" and "<b>Refinería</b>" refer to his administration's two hallmark infrastructure projects, the Mayan Train and the Dos Bocas Refinery. The Mayan Train is a $16 billion, 1000-mile intercity railway that will traverse the Yucatán peninsula in Southeast Mexico, and Dos Bocas is a $12 billion oil refinery located in the Southeastern state of Tabasco poised to be Mexico's largest. Both projects have faced significant pushback from local communities and from the general public, which explains the administration's constant promotion of them in social media.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">"<b>Oaxaca</b>" and "<b>Guerrero</b>", other two of AMLO's most tweeted words, are the names of two underdeveloped Mexican states on which his government has focused its social policy. Welfare, or "<b>bienestar</b>", has been another of the administration's pillars, and citizens in these states are among the most heavily targeted by social programs. Finally, another relevant term in AMLO's tweets is "<b>Guardia Nacional</b>", or National Guard, a civilian police force to which his administration has been assigning increasingly significant administrative and political roles within the government. Recently, the president announced the plan of merging the National Guard into the Army, a move that <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/04/29/mexicos-president-is-giving-the-armed-forces-new-powers">has been critized</a> given his campaign commitment to demilitarize public safety operations in the country.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify; line-height:40px; font-size: 16px;">For President Erdoğan, many of the most relevant terms and phrases are salutations and greetings. The most relevant one is “hayırlı olmasını diliyorum” (32 times), which translates to “I wish you good luck”. Another similar terms in the top ten are “milletimize hayırlı olmasını” (12 times), which translates to “good luck to our nation”, and “tebrik ediyorum” (31 times), which translates to “congratulations”. These phrases do not refer to one particular event or legislation that occurred in 2021. Instead, they are used by President Erdoğan to wish for the success of various events throughout the year. For example, he used the phrase “hayırlı olmasını diliyorum” to wish good luck for the opening of the New Adana Stadium on February 19, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1362824271467339777">(link)</a>, for the launch of the Türksat 5A satellite on June 28, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1409500741300109315">(link)</a>, and that the newly launched Turkovac coronavirus vaccine benefit all of humanity on December 22, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1473619005953003523">(link)</a>. The first phrase not to  be in a salutation is the 19th one, “gazi mustafa kemal” (five times). Gazi is a Turkish title for veterans and Turkic Muslim champions, and “mustafa kemal” is referring to  Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founding father of the Republic of Turkey who served as its first president from 1923 to 1938. The Tweets featuring Mustafa Kemal Atatürk are about honoring his legacy. For example, President Erdoğan commemorated Turkey’s Republic Day on October 29 by thanking Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and expressing his gratitude for founding the modern republic <a href="https://twitter.com/RTErdogan/status/1453964816092123136">(link)</a>. Overall, based on an analysis of the most frequent keywords and phrases, President Erdoğan uses Twitter to show gratitude for projects and initiatives, and to spotlight positive developments.</p>
